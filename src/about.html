                    We're courtyard, a six piece indie-rock outfit from Rochester, New York. Currently, we're
                    working on our debut, four-track, self-titled EP. We enjoy writing bops, getting noise complaints, 
                    and occasionally playing decent music. 
                    <br><br>
                    Incidentally, we're also very popular for freelance jazz bookings
                    amongst the RIT community. Let us know if you ever want us at your show (or banquet, ball, gala, party)!
